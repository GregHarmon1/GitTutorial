In order to deploy our project, we need to change two settings, so on the main page for your repository click settings.

First, make sure to name the project exactly the same as YOUR github username. The example above is for a user (or organization) named CEN3031-10A.

Save the rename, and secondly, scroll all the way down to the Github Pages section of this settings page.

Make sure the dropdown box is set to build from master, save your changes again and refresh the page.

If you did everything right, it should look like the following and your link will redirect to your site!
